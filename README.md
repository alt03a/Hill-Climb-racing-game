🕹️ Gesture-Controlled Game Controller for Hill Climb Racing
Control the Hill Climb Racing game using just your ✋ hand gestures — no keyboard or joystick needed!

This project combines 🧠 computer vision and 💻 real-time hand tracking to make gameplay more immersive and fun.

🎮 Features
🖐️ Raise Hand → Accelerate
✊ Make a Fist → Brake
🎥 Works with just a webcam
⚡️ Real-time response
🧩 Compatible with other keyboard-controlled games too!

🧰 Tech Stack
🔧 Tool	💡 Purpose
🖐️ MediaPipe	Hand detection & tracking
👁️ OpenCV	Image capture & processing
⌨️ pynput	Keyboard event simulation
🐍 Python	Core logic & integration
🚀 Getting Started
✅ Requirements
Python 3.7+
Webcam
Hill Climb Racing (or any keyboard-based game)
📦 Install Dependencies
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pynput
▶️ Run the Controller
python gesture_controller.py
🧠 How It Works
📸 OpenCV captures live video → 🖐️ MediaPipe tracks hand landmarks → 🧠 Gestures are recognized → ⌨️ pynput simulates keypresses → 🎮 Game responds in real time!

Gesture Mappings:

✋ Open Hand → Accelerate
✊ Fist → Brake
💡 Applications
🔹 Gesture-based gaming 🔹 Accessibility & assistive tech 🔹 Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) 🔹 Computer Vision & AI learning projects
